# Network Access Setup Guide

## Your Media Server is Now Network Accessible! üåê

Your media server has been configured to accept connections from other devices on your local network.

### Access URLs

**From this computer:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001

**From other devices on your network:**
- Frontend: http://162.206.88.79:3000
- Backend API: http://162.206.88.79:3001

### Testing from Other Devices

1. **On your phone/tablet:**
   - Open a web browser (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
   - Navigate to: `http://162.206.88.79:3000`
   - You should see your media server login page
   - **Mobile Optimized**: The interface is now fully responsive with:
     - Touch-friendly buttons and inputs
     - Mobile navigation menu
     - Responsive tables and forms
     - Optimized text sizes and spacing

2. **On another computer:**
   - Open any web browser
   - Navigate to: `http://162.206.88.79:3000`
   - Login with your credentials

### Important Notes

- **Firewall**: Windows Firewall might block incoming connections. If you can't access from other devices, you may need to:
  - Allow Node.js through Windows Firewall
  - Or temporarily disable Windows Firewall for testing
  
- **Network Requirements**: 
  - All devices must be on the same local network (Wi-Fi or Ethernet)
  - Your IP address (162.206.88.79) should remain the same while testing

### Troubleshooting

If you can't access from other devices:

1. **Check Firewall:**
   ```powershell
   # Run as Administrator
   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Node.js Server" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3000
   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Node.js API" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3001
   ```

2. **Verify Services are Running:**
   ```powershell
   netstat -an | Select-String ":300"
   ```
   Should show both ports 3000 and 3001 listening on 0.0.0.0

3. **Test from this computer first:**
   - Visit: http://162.206.88.79:3000
   - If this doesn't work, there's a configuration issue

### Security Considerations

- This setup is for **testing only** on your local network
- Before deploying to production, consider:
  - HTTPS/SSL certificates
  - Proper authentication
  - Firewall rules
  - Network security

### Mobile Optimization Features

Your media server is now fully optimized for mobile devices:

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to all screen sizes (phones, tablets, desktops)
- **Touch-Friendly Interface**: Larger buttons and touch targets
- **Mobile Navigation**: Collapsible hamburger menu on mobile
- **Optimized Forms**: Better input sizing and mobile keyboard handling
- **Responsive Tables**: Admin tables convert to mobile-friendly cards
- **Mobile Admin Management**: Full admin capabilities on mobile including:
  - Easy invite code creation with touch-friendly forms
  - Mobile-optimized invite code cards with copy/delete actions
  - Tap-to-reveal full invite codes
  - Enhanced confirmation dialogs for mobile
  - Touch-friendly user management
- **Tab Navigation**: Dropdown selectors on mobile for better UX
- **iOS Safari Compatible**: Prevents zoom on input focus

### Starting the Server

To start both frontend and backend:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start with network access and mobile optimization enabled automatically.
